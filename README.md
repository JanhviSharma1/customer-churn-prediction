## Churn Analysis – End-to-End Data Pipeline & Predictive Modeling
## Key Components
## ETL Pipeline (SSMS)
Developed a full ETL process using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

Transformed raw data into structured dimension and fact tables for efficient churn analysis.

## Data Preprocessing
Performed extensive data cleaning, feature engineering, and preprocessing to prepare for analysis and modeling.

## Interactive Dashboard (Power BI)
Built a detailed Power BI dashboard to visualize churn patterns by:

Demographics

Geographic regions

Service usage

Payment methods

Enabled stakeholders to identify high-risk segments and focus marketing/retention efforts.

## Machine Learning Model
Trained a Random Forest Classifier to predict customer churn.

Achieved an accuracy of 84%, supporting proactive customer retention strategies.

## Tech Stack
SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) – Data modeling & ETL

Power BI – Data visualization

Python (scikit-learn, pandas) – Data transformation & modeling

## Highlights
Real-world simulation of data engineering + analytics + ML pipeline

Designed for data-driven decision-making and stakeholder communication

End-to-end project: From raw data to business impact
