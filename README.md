## Churn Analysis – End-to-End Data Pipeline & Predictive Modeling

This project showcases a complete data workflow — from raw data ingestion to business intelligence and predictive modeling.

## Key Components

### ETL Pipeline (SSMS)
Developed a full ETL process using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).  
Transformed raw data into structured dimension and fact tables for efficient churn analysis.

### Data Preprocessing
Performed extensive data cleaning, feature engineering, and preprocessing using Python libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn to prepare the data for analysis and modeling.

### Interactive Dashboard (Power BI)
Built a detailed Power BI dashboard to visualize churn patterns by:
- Demographics  
- Geographic regions  
- Service usage  
- Payment methods  

Enabled stakeholders to identify high-risk segments and focus marketing/retention efforts.

### Machine Learning Model
Trained a Random Forest Classifier to predict customer churn.  
Achieved an accuracy of 84%, supporting proactive customer retention strategies.
